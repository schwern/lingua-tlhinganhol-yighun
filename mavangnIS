Things we have to do, or items to consider.

- yInargh 'last' and nargh 'quotemeta' possibly clash.
- yInargh 'last', yItaH 'next', yInIDqa' 'redo' on the one hand clash with
  jaH 'goto' on the other hand (which has no 'yI').
  Also, the 'go' verbs take a $sing in front of them, so currently even
  'yIyItaH' would be legal. This seems nonsense to me.
  Either make them all take a mandatory 'yI-' (including, then, yIjaH),
  or make 'yI-' optional on all of them, so %v_go contains only the keys
  qw/jaH nargh taH nIDqa'/. (Modulo possible clash on nargh 'quotemeta'.)
- We can't goto anywhere since we can't do labels yet.
