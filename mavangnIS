Things we have to do, or items to consider.

- yInargh 'last' and nargh 'quotemeta' possibly clash.
- yInargh 'last', yItaH 'next', yInIDqa' 'redo' on the one hand clash
  with jaH 'goto' on the other hand (which has no 'yI').
  Also, the 'go' verbs take a $sing in front of them, so currently even
  'yIyItaH' would be legal. This seems nonsense to me.
  Either make them all take a mandatory 'yI-' (including, then, yIjaH),
  or make 'yI-' optional on all of them, so %v_go contains only the keys
  qw/jaH nargh taH nIDqa'/. (Modulo possible clash on nargh
  'quotemeta'.)
- We can't goto anywhere since we can't do labels yet.
- Variables can't contain colons or underscores, since the rule for
  arbitrary variables uses EOW and that checks for [^a-zA-Z']. Which is
  fine for Klingon names, but sometimes you have to call subroutines or
  access variables in other packages which contain underscores (for the
  variable/subroutine name itself) or colons (for accessing the package
  containing the variable/subroutine). Proposed solution: EOW should
  probably be changed to accept ':' and '_' as well.
- Match and search operations can't specify options (egimosx).
  This can be partially compensated by adding an (?egimosx:) inside the
  regular expression "line noise", but we might wish to consider
  allowing the user to specify the options somehow. Not sure whether to
  do so with a string ("egimosx"), a list ("e", "g", "i"), or through
  Klingon words.
  We could also decide always to set certain options (such as /x), but
  I'm not sure this is desirable.
- We can't call time() (or localtime, gmtime).
  This should probably be fixed.
- arg1 always pops the stack, even for obligatorily 0-arg functions.
  This should be fixed.
